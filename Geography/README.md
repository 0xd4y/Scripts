This is one of the first python scripts I made. It's a little geography game that randomly asks you what the capital of a country is or what the country's capital is. There are no duplicate questions, and it can be a fun way to pass the time on a road trip.

The script must be run inside the same directory as the Countries.txt and Capitals.txt files. The code isn't particularly efficient and I have become better over the years, but it's a fun little game nevertheless. I hope you enjoy it!
