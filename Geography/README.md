# Geography.py

This is one of the first python scripts I made. It's a little geography game that randomly asks you what the capital of a country is or what the country's capital is. You can either get a question correct without hints, incorrect, correct with hints, or close (such as if you misspelled or forgot the exact name of the capital or country). The percentage correct is calculated by the following equation:

Note how questions you used a hint on do not count toward or against your percentage correct. There are no duplicate questions, and it can be a fun way to pass the time on a road trip!

## Important Note
The script must be run inside the same directory as the Countries.txt and Capitals.txt files. The code isn't particularly efficient and I learned a lot since making it, but it's a fun little game nevertheless. I hope you enjoy it!
